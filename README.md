## My process

### Built with

- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)


### What I learned

This is my first Vue project, and it was tricky towards the end because of the way Vue checks for props changes. However, I was able to fix my mistakes and complete the challenge successfully.


### Continued development

The project works fine now. But it could use some animations and transitions. I will add them in the future.
